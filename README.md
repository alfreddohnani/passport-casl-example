That's a simple example on how to authenticate users with [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) and authorize resources with CASL Node packages.

The project is created with Node and Express as the server.

## Setup

To run locally, simply clone the project and download the npm dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then, start the server:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

The app will start up at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

Take a look at the db/users.js file to check for some valid usernames and passwords, or create yours.
